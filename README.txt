A simple art program built upon Zelle's graphics package. 
designs creates some intersting designs with the package using simple algorithms.  
The myWin class is a simple extension of the graphwin class (from zelle's package) that 
enables the window to be aware of what shapes are inside it.  
This allows for resizing the windows more easily.  

The main function is a user interface for the application.

Complex designs may take a significant amount of time to fully render on the screen.  
The process can be sped up by minimizing the graphics window that is currently being drawn to.




Note:
I did not design the graphics package nor did I have any role in creating it.  
That package accompanies: Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science by John M. Zelle.
